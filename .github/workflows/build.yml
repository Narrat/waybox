# A GitHub Actions port of the old .build.yml.  This has the advantage of being
# able to use GitHub actions, contexts, secrets, etc, to do more in the future
# than merely check whether a build succeeds or fails.  It also allows to see
# whether builds succeed or fail on forks, which also has its advantages.
#
# The disadvantage is that it's less portable than .build.yml, which will work
# on at least GitHub, GitLab, and SourceHut, where GitHub Actions only work on
# GitHub.
